# Overview

 For this trial, I tried to built an environment which is essential for application development. 
By using C# and .Net, I examine how each soft ware work together while write a code and run the program.
BY using specific command from .Net, we can develop software in C# so easily. I also examine how we can save and track each progress in Github by linking Vscode and Github together. 

I create a Software which show "Hello World!!" in C#

To demonstrate my basic knowledge and skill of using VScode, dotnet, and C#.

For this software, I used Github, Vscode and .Net.

The programming language that used this time is C#.
